**The word guess game is a futuristic virtual reality themed Hangman game. Once the window is loaded, press any button to start. You will select a letter by clicking the corresponding button for your choice. You are allowed 10 lives per word.** 

## Rules
1. If the letter you selected is included in the hidden word, it will show up in place of the under_score, and no lives will be taken away.

1. If the letter you selected is not in the hidden word, the button will disappear as an option, and you will lose a life.

2. If you select all the letters to decode the hidden word, you will get an alert "YOU WIN". 

3. If you fail to decode the hidden word before running out of your allotted 10 lives, you will get an alert "YOU LOSE".

4. The game can be restarted at any time by pressing the "Play Again" button.
